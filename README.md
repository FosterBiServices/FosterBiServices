# 👋 Hey, I'm Steven!

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a **Power BI enthusiast** with over **7 years of experience** in designing and optimizing data-driven solutions. My expertise lies in **data modeling, DAX optimization, and report development**, ensuring high performance, readability, and scalability.  

I've mentored junior developers, helping them master **DAX, data modeling best practices, and external tools** like:  
- 🔹 **Tabular Editor** (for improved performance & documentation)  
- 🔹 **DAX Studio** (for deep analysis and query optimization)  

Beyond functionality, I believe in **enhancing Power BI aesthetics**—I leverage **Figma** to craft custom report backgrounds and elevate dashboard UI/UX.  

## 🔥 Currently Learning  
I'm transitioning into **Data Engineering**, with a focus on:  
- 🏗 **Databricks**  
- 🐍 **Python for data transformation & automation**
